6.	1. Network Topology Observed at KJSIT
7.	The network topology observed at K. J. Somaiya Institute of Technology (KJSIT) follows a Hierarchical (Hybrid Star) topology.
•	The central point of the network is the Core Switch (Cisco Catalyst 3850) located in the server room.
•	This core switch connects to multiple access switches on each floor via fiber uplinks (SFP).
•	Each access switch, in turn, connects to multiple end-user systems and devices, forming a star structure at each floor level.
Hence, the overall structure forms a hierarchical star topology, where each floor has its own local star network connected hierarchically to the central core.
8.	Justification:
•	The use of a core switch (distribution layer) and multiple access switches (access layer) demonstrates a hierarchical design.
•	Fiber interconnections and independent subnet IP ranges per floor ensure scalability and ease of management.

10.	2. Key Networking Devices and Their Roles
11.	The KJSIT network includes the following key devices:
12.	Device	13.	Model	14.	Function
15.	Firewall	16.	SonicWALL NSA 460	17.	Protects the internal network by filtering traffic and blocking 								unauthorized access.
18.	Core Switch	19.	Cisco Catalyst 3850 (24 + 4 SFP)	20.	Acts as the backbone of the network, managing 											traffic between all building switches.
21.	Access Switches	22.	Cisco SG500, SG300, SG200 Series	23.	Provide connectivity to computers, lab PCs, and 										Wi-Fi access points on each floor.
24.	Router/Multiplexer	25.	Bharat Airtel ISP Gateway	26.	Connects the institute’s LAN to the external 											internet via a 150 Mbps leased line.
27.	Servers	28.	DHCP, DNS, Authentication	29.	Manage dynamic IP assignments, name resolution, and user access 								control.
30.	Interconnections:
•	The core switch connects to each floor’s access switch via fiber optic uplinks (SFP).
•	Access switches then distribute connectivity to local PCs and access points through Ethernet.
•	The firewall connects between the ISP multiplexer and the core switch to secure all inbound and outbound data.

32.	3. IP Addressing and Subnetting Implementation
•	Each switch and device in the KJSIT network has a unique static IP address (e.g., 192.168.x.x range).
•	IP addresses are logically assigned based on floor numbers and departments, simplifying network segmentation.
•	Subnetting ensures that each department or floor has its own subnet, which:
o	Reduces broadcast traffic.
o	Increases network efficiency.
o	Makes troubleshooting and management easier.
33.	Example:
•	192.168.1.x → Server Room and Core
•	192.168.2.x → Ground Floor
•	192.168.3.x → 1st Floor, etc.
34.	This structured addressing improves scalability and simplifies network administration.

36.	4. Configuration and Security Mechanisms on Servers
37.	During observation, the following configurations and security mechanisms were identified:
•	DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Automatically assigns IP addresses to client devices within each subnet.
•	DNS (Domain Name System): Resolves hostnames to IP addresses for internal and external communication.
•	Firewall (SonicWALL NSA 460): Provides packet filtering, intrusion prevention, and access control lists (ACLs).
•	Authentication (Active Directory/Local Server): Manages user logins, permissions, and access to shared resources.
•	Bandwidth Management and Logging: Tracks and limits network usage per department or lab.
38.	These configurations ensure that only authorized users and devices can access the network securely.
39.	________________________________________
40.	5. Suggested Improvement or Upgrade
41.	Suggestion: Implement Network Monitoring and Management Software (e.g., PRTG, SolarWinds, or Cisco Prime).
42.	Justification:
•	Currently, network management may rely on manual supervision.
•	By adding a centralized monitoring system, administrators can:
o	Track real-time bandwidth usage and detect anomalies.
o	Receive alerts for switch or link failures.
o	Optimize traffic flow and enhance uptime.
•	This would greatly improve network reliability, security, and performance.
